                The Artform of Locking now has several decades of contributors, Each decade has Locking dancers who are now icons in the world of Streetdance, However this room is dedicated to the Many ORIGINAL pioneers,  who deserve recognition for their contribution to the Art and Sub-Culture of Locking. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of these dancers we refer to as Masters or Ogs were around before the Group ‘The Lockers “were presented as a group to the public in 1973. They were there during the sharing and development stages of the dance. These are the dancers who were on Soul Train and in the nightclubs of Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p>
                YES There are many people with different levels of contributions to the history of the art, And lockerlegends looks forward to expanding our Hall to include various phases of contributions, but these are some the ORIGINAL, main & true old school pioneers who contributed steps, style and the attitude which created and contributed to the evolution of the entire sub-culture we know as “Locking”

The  others who did the dance of locking from other eras or decades within locking we refer to as 70s ,80s & 90s 0ldSchool or new school pioneers , or simply BG’s , this terminology is in direct connection with street respect terminology.</p>
